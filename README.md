## TODO

Programming:

- Merge main menu made by TheBugMaker
- Oxygen mechanic (dropping slowly + bubble giving more)
	- Regain oxygen by going to surface
- Collision with fish and boat parts
- Picking up a survivor and dragging him/her to the surface -> move slower
- Spawning obstacles (fish and boat parts) randomly but not in a dumb way (no overlapping and not too close to each other or to survivors)
- Spawning bubbles randomly and make them disappear after a bit of time
- Smooth the camera movements

Art:
- Humans and the diver
	- Diver's animation is the most important, main character, always in the middle of the screen
- Water background
- Main part of the boat that is sinking slowly in the background?
- Safety boat waiting for the survivors
- More fishes
- Little logo of bubbles to put near the oxygen bar
